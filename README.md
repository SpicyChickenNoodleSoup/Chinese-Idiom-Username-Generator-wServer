# Chinese-Idiom-Username-Generator-wServer
A rather out-of-the-box personal web development and web scraping passion project with HTML, CSS, Javascript using Chinese Idiom dataset from https://github.com/by-syk/chinese-idiom-db by @by_syk. A WeChat or gaming username generator that suggests username based on Chinese Idioms based on name input. 
First attempt at HTML, CSS, Javascript, and building a Flask server with Python.

Test it on http://spicychickennoodlesoup.pythonanywhere.com/
